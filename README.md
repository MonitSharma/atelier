# 🎩 Atelier

**A fully local, zero-cost, dual-mode AI agent that runs on a single MacBook.**

*Answer questions over your own notes. Read and fix your code with test-verified changes.
No cloud, no API keys, no subscriptions — your data never leaves the machine.*

</div>

---

Atelier is one agent harness with **two capability modes**:

- 🧠 **Knowledge mode** — retrieval-augmented Q&A grounded in *your own* notes, PDFs, and code.
- 🔧 **Build mode** — an autonomous agent that reads a repo, edits code, runs tests, and fixes failures, **proving** each change with a green test run.

It runs entirely against a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) server and local
embedding models. It also ships persistent **memory**, an **MCP server** so other
tools can use its toolbox, **hybrid retrieval**, a **LoRA-fine-tuned router** that
sends easy work to a cheap model, and a **self-evaluation harness** that measures
its own reliability — and reports where it fails.

> **Why local-only?** The research question this project answers is *"how far can a
> fully local, $0 agent go on one laptop?"* The constraints are the point, not a
> limitation. Privacy is a free side effect: nothing is ever sent to a third party.

Everything above runs on-device. Full design notes: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## Requirements

- **macOS on Apple Silicon** (built & tested on **M3 Pro, 36 GB**). Other Apple
  Silicon Macs with ≥16 GB should work with smaller models.
- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)** installed and running (`ollama serve`).
- **Python 3.11+** and **[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**.
- ~5 GB free disk for models (more if you add the heavy model).

The local models Atelier uses by role:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:14b    # "brain"  — reasoning + build mode (default)
ollama pull qwen3:4b     # "worker" — fast/cheap subtasks + the LLM judge
ollama pull gemma4:26b   # "heavy"  — optional, for the hardest reasoning (--heavy)
```

Embedding and router models download automatically from Hugging Face on first use
(`bge-base-en-v1.5` ~110 MB; the 0.5B router base ~300 MB; optional reranker ~80 MB).

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> atelier && cd atelier

uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt     # pinned, reproducible deps
uv pip install -e .                     # installs the `atelier` command

atelier doctor                          # verify models + vector store + embeddings
```

`atelier doctor` should show all three models green. If one is red, run the
`ollama pull` it prints.

> **No banner in scripts?** Set `ATELIER_NO_BANNER=1` to suppress the ASCII banner.

---

## 5-minute quickstart

```bash
# 1) Index some notes (point it at anything — an Obsidian vault, a papers folder)
atelier ingest ~/Notes ./Project.md

# 2) Ask a question grounded in what you indexed
atelier ask "What did I decide about the embedding model and why?"

# 3) Let the agent fix a bug and prove it with tests
atelier agent "Fix the failing test in sample_task/ and prove it passes"

# 4) Teach it something it will remember next session
atelier remember "I prefer Apache-2.0 and pytest" --tags prefs
atelier recall "what license do I like?"
```

---

## What's been built — the phases

Atelier was built in eight phases (0–7); **all are complete**. Each shipped a
working capability and is verified by tests and/or the eval harness. The
authoritative log lives in [`PROJECT.md`](PROJECT.md) (Decision Log + Changelog).

| Phase | Title | What it delivered | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | The loop, from scratch | A hand-written ReAct loop (perceive→plan→act→observe), a local Ollama client, and one verifiable tool (an AST-sandboxed calculator). | `agent/loop.py`, `agent/brain.py`, `tools/calculator.py` |
| **1** | Tools & the protocol | A `Tool`/`ToolRegistry` abstraction and the full toolbox: file read/write/edit (workspace-sandboxed), local search, repo map, **sandboxed code execution**, a **pytest runner**, plus an **MCP server** publishing them all. | `tools/`, `atelier/mcp_server.py` |
| **2** | Knowledge mode (RAG) | Ingest (md/txt/pdf/code) → heading-aware chunking → local embeddings → ChromaDB → retrieval → **grounded, cited answers**. | `rag/` |
| **3** | Memory & state | Persistent, semantic long-term memory in its own vector collection; `remember`/`recall` as both CLI commands and agent tools; cross-session persistence. | `agent/memory.py`, `tools/memory_tools.py` |
| **4** | Build mode + reliability | A registry-driven ReAct engine with **reflection** (recovers from tool/parse errors), observation capping, and full **trace logging**. Verified live: the agent fixes a failing test and proves it. | `agent/react.py` |
| **5** | Evaluation & reliability | Two **frozen** task suites (doc-QA + code), deterministic metrics + an optional local **LLM-as-judge**, a runner with JSON reports, and a **regression gate**. | `eval/` |
| **6** | Specialization (routing) | A **LoRA-fine-tuned 0.5B** difficulty classifier routes easy tasks to the cheap model; measured savings. | `models/router/`, `agent/router.py` |
| **7** | Capstone & release | **One-command reproduction** (`make reproduce`), a public **writeup with a figure** and honest failure analysis, and full architecture docs. | `Makefile`, `scripts/`, `docs/` |

Beyond the phases, two engineering improvements were driven *by* the eval (not
guessed): the file-edit tools now run a Python `compile()` check and report
`syntax_ok` so the agent knows instantly when an edit breaks a file; and the
brain client handles `qwen3` "thinking" traces and JSON-mode tool calls robustly.

---

## Usage guide

All commands assume the venv is active (`source .venv/bin/activate`).

### Knowledge mode

```bash
# Index files or whole folders (md, txt, pdf, and source code are supported)
atelier ingest ~/Notes ~/Papers ./Project.md
atelier ingest --reset ~/Notes          # rebuild the index from scratch
atelier sources                          # list what's currently indexed

# Ask, grounded in your corpus
atelier ask "Which embedding model did I choose and why?"
atelier ask -k 8 --show-context "what is build mode's verifier?"   # more context + show passages
atelier ask --heavy "summarize my design decisions"                # use the bigger model

# Interactive session
atelier chat
```

Answers cite sources as `[1] [2]` and list the files used. If the corpus doesn't
contain the answer, the agent says so rather than inventing one — that's by design
and is what the eval's *groundedness* checks measure.

### Build mode (the agent)

```bash
atelier tools                            # list the toolbox the agent can use

# Autonomous, test-verified coding
atelier agent "Fix the failing test in sample_task/ and prove it passes"

# Knowledge + build in one task
atelier agent "Using my notes on X, implement Y in this repo and add a test"
```

Flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--heavy` | Use `gemma4:26b` instead of `qwen3:14b` |
| `--memory` | Recall relevant long-term memories into context first |
| `--shell` | Enable the powerful (lightly guarded) `shell` tool |
| `--max-steps N` | Bound the reasoning loop (default 10) |
| `--quiet` | Don't stream each step |

Every run streams its steps and writes a full JSON **trace** to `data/traces/`,
so you can inspect exactly what the agent did.

> **Safety:** file/test tools are pinned to the project workspace; `code_exec`
> runs in a subprocess with a timeout and (on macOS) a seatbelt profile that
> blocks network access. The `shell` tool is opt-in. See
> [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the exact guarantees.

### Memory

```bash
atelier remember "I prefer Apache-2.0 and pytest over unittest" --tags prefs
atelier recall  "what testing framework does the user like?"
atelier memory                            # list all stored facts
atelier agent --memory "scaffold a module the way I like it"
```

Memory persists across sessions (it lives in a local ChromaDB collection) and is
recalled by **meaning**, not exact words. The agent also has `remember`/`recall`
tools, so it can choose to store facts mid-task.

### Routing

A LoRA-fine-tuned **0.5B** model classifies a task `easy`/`hard` in milliseconds,
so easy subtasks can go to the cheap worker and the 14B brain is reserved for hard
ones (the "small model as a cheap component" pattern).

```bash
atelier route "what is 47 * 89?"                    # easy → qwen3:4b
atelier route "refactor auth across the codebase"   # hard → qwen3:14b
atelier route --backend heuristic "..."             # no model, keyword heuristic

make train-router                                   # reproduce the fine-tune (~1 min)
python -m eval.route_eval                            # measure routing savings
```

If the adapter isn't trained, the router transparently falls back to a keyword
heuristic — nothing depends on the fine-tune at runtime.

### MCP server

Expose Atelier's whole toolbox to any [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
client (Claude Desktop/Code, etc.):

```bash
atelier mcp        # speaks JSON-RPC over stdio
```

Point your MCP host's server command at `atelier mcp`. It publishes 11 tools:
`calculator`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `search`, `search_notes`,
`repo_map`, `code_exec`, `test_runner`, `remember`, `recall` (add `--shell` for the
shell tool).

### Evaluation

```bash
atelier eval                  # score both modes, print tables, save a JSON report
atelier eval --mode docqa     # knowledge mode only
atelier eval --mode code      # build mode only
atelier eval --judge          # add the local LLM-as-judge (groundedness)
atelier eval --gate           # FAIL (exit 1) if any metric regressed vs the last report
```

Reports are saved to `data/eval_reports/`. The suites in `eval/tasks_docqa/` and
`eval/tasks_code/` are **frozen on purpose** — add new tasks, don't edit existing
ones, or you invalidate comparisons.

## Configuration reference

Everything is overridable via environment variables (prefix `ATELIER_`) or a
`.env` file in the repo root. Defaults live in [`atelier/config.py`](atelier/config.py).

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ATELIER_OLLAMA_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Local Ollama endpoint |

| `ATELIER_HEAVY_MODEL` | `gemma4:26b` | Optional heavy reasoner (`--heavy`) |
| `ATELIER_TEMPERATURE` | `0.1` | Sampling temperature |
| `ATELIER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | `600` | Per-request timeout (s) |
| `ATELIER_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` | `12000` | Cap on retrieved context fed to the model |
| `ATELIER_EMBED_MODEL` | `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` | Local embedding model |
| `ATELIER_EMBED_DEVICE` | `mps` | `mps` (Apple GPU), `cuda`, or `cpu` |
| `ATELIER_CHUNK_SIZE` | `1000` | Chunk size (characters) |
| `ATELIER_CHUNK_OVERLAP` | `150` | Chunk overlap (characters) |
| `ATELIER_RETRIEVAL_K` | `6` | Chunks retrieved per query |
| `ATELIER_USE_HYBRID` | `true` | Fuse dense + BM25 retrieval (RRF) |

| `ATELIER_RERANK_MODEL` | `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` | Reranker model |

Example:

export ATELIER_BRAIN_MODEL=gemma4:26b
export ATELIER_RETRIEVAL_K=8
export ATELIER_RERANK=1
```

---

## Models & hardware budget

| Role | Default model | Resident RAM (approx.) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brain | `qwen3:14b` (4-bit) | ~9 GB | Comfortable on 36 GB alongside the rest |
| Worker / router target | `qwen3:4b` | ~2.5 GB | Fast iteration, cheap subtasks |
| Heavy (optional) | `gemma4:26b` | ~17 GB | For the hardest reasoning only |
| Embeddings | `bge-base-en-v1.5` | ~0.5 GB | Runs on the Apple GPU (MPS) |
| Router | `Qwen2.5-0.5B` + LoRA | ~1.5 GB (train) | Fine-tune is ~1 min on M3 Pro |

**Rule of thumb:** keep the brain ≤ ~14B so the embedding model, vector store,
tools, and OS all breathe within 36 GB. Don't run the brain and a heavy
fine-tune simultaneously — serialize them.

---

## Reliability results

From the frozen eval suites on an M3 Pro with `qwen3:14b` (full analysis and
honest caveats in [`docs/EVAL.md`](docs/EVAL.md) and the writeup in
[`docs/WRITEUP.md`](docs/WRITEUP.md)):

**Knowledge mode (8 questions over the real corpus)**

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Correct | **100%** (8/8) |
| Retrieval hit@k | **100%** (8/8) |
| Citation rate | **75%** (6/8) ← the gap to close |

**Build mode (3 fix-the-failing-test tasks)**

| Task | Solved |
|---|---|
| add_bug (single-line) | ✅ |
| offbyone (single-line) | ✅ |
| median_bug (multi-line if/else) | ❌ |
| **Overall** | **67%** (2/3) |

The unsolved task is the *finding*: `qwen3:14b` reliably makes single-line fixes
but is unreliable on multi-line **structural** edits — a clean measurement of the
local-model reasoning ceiling, not something hidden.

**Router (fine-tuned 0.5B)**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Base accuracy (held-out) | 43.8% |
| Fine-tuned accuracy | **100%** (+56 pts) |
| Brain calls saved (doc-QA) | **50%**, with **0 accuracy loss** |

---

## Reproduce everything

```bash
make reproduce        # env → models → tests → eval → train + evaluate router
make help             # list all tasks
```

Or step by step:

```bash
make setup            # uv venv + install
make test             # unit suite (no model)
make ingest           # index the sample corpus
make eval             # reliability eval
make train-router     # LoRA fine-tune + evaluate the router (~1 min)
make route-eval       # measure routing savings
make demo             # quick end-to-end build-mode demo
```

Artifacts produced: the trained adapter (`models/router/adapter/`), JSON reports
(`data/eval_reports/`), and per-run traces (`data/traces/`).

---

## Testing

A complete, ability-by-ability test playbook (with expected outputs) lives in
[`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md). The fast automated suite needs **no model**:

```bash
pytest -q             # 54 tests: tools, sandbox/escape guards, chunking,
                      # vector store, ReAct engine, memory, retrieval, router, eval
```

The tests that touch the live model (knowledge/build/eval) are run on demand via
the `atelier` commands and `make` targets, not in the fast suite.

Runtime data (the vector store, traces, eval reports, memory) lives under `data/`
and is gitignored — it's local and regenerable.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `atelier doctor` shows a model **red** | Run the `ollama pull <model>` it prints; ensure `ollama serve` is running |
| "Could not reach Ollama" | Start Ollama (`ollama serve`) or set `ATELIER_OLLAMA_URL` |
| `atelier` command not found | `uv pip install -e .` (or use `python -m atelier.cli ...`) |
| First `ask`/`ingest` is slow | One-time embedding-model download; subsequent runs are fast |
| Embeddings fall back to CPU | Expected if MPS is unavailable; set `ATELIER_EMBED_DEVICE=cpu` to silence |
| Agent loops without finishing | Lower task complexity, raise `--max-steps`, or try `--heavy` |
| Banner clutters piped output | `export ATELIER_NO_BANNER=1` |
| Knowledge base "empty" | Run `atelier ingest <path>` first; check `atelier sources` |

## Limitations (read these)

This project values honest limits over optimism:

- **It will not beat cloud coding agents** (Claude Code, Cursor). A local small
  model can't, and that's an explicit non-goal.
- **Multi-line structural code edits are the reliability ceiling** for the 14B
  brain — measured, not hidden (see [results](#reliability-results)).
- **The eval suites are small** (8 + 3). 100% on knowledge means "no obvious
  failures on a modest corpus," not "robust at scale."
- **The router's held-out test is in-distribution** (templated). It generalizes
  well in spot-checks but isn't a generalization benchmark.
- **Correctness scoring is keyword-based** by default; the optional local
  LLM-judge is a second, also-fallible opinion.

"""Measure the routing win on a real workload (the doc-QA suite).

For each question we: classify it with the router, answer it with the worker
(4B) and with the brain (14B), and score both. From this we report:
  * how many questions route to the cheap model (brain calls saved);
  * whether routed answers stay correct vs. always-brain (does routing hurt?).

This is the concrete Phase 6 claim, measured rather than assumed.
